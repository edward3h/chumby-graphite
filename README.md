Graphite graphs on Chumby
=========================

These scripts take over a Chumby and use it to display graphs from [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/)

Installation
------------

Copy the files to a USB stick. Edit the graphite server name in the `draw_graph.pl` file to refer to your
server. Edit the `@target` array in the `draw_graph.pl` file to refer to your graphs.

Plug the USB stick in your Chumby and boot it up!
